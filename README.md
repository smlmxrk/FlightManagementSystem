# FlightManagementSystem

A simulation of a flight management system made to monitor the status, departure time, arrival times, and different
variables of the operations of an airport.

The main purpose of this project is to familiarize myself with creating relatively basic GUIs using Java swing, as well as get familiar with connecting to a database & handling data.
